# DC-Variable-Power-Supply
Built and analyzed a power supply circuit to understand fundamental power electronics concepts such as rectification, voltage regulation, filtering, and protection circuits.
Simulated and analyzed the circuit in multisim to calculate output voltage of the supply along with obtaining it's respective output waveforms.
gained hands-on experience working with AC-DC conversion, voltage regulators, transformers, and capacitors to filter noise and provide a stable output voltage.

Project is currently only made in simulation, however I will be creating a pcb board in the next week for the design in Altium designer and soldering the components.

Circuit and it's corresponding waveforms are pictured below
